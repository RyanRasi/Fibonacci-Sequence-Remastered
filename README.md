# Fibonacci-Sequence-Remastered
Allows a user to find the 1000th term of the Fibonacci sequence as well as displays that number in its full form.
<br><br>
This uses the wolfram alpha equation for the fibonnaci sequence and also uses big integers to hold the large numbers that is required from the term in the sequence due to them being too big to fit in an int.
<br><br>
Then there is a for loop that goes up to the term defined which is the 1000th and then calculates every term until it gets to the 1000th one.

Most the code is also commented for easy viewing and understanding
